			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I am a second-year computer science student currently studying at the Illinois Institute of Technology. I am also a Teaching Assistant for CS 350 (Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming).</p>
			<p>In addition to pursuing my studies, I'm in the process of searching for a software development internship position for summer 2018. If you are looking for an intern with a solid foundation in computer science concepts (as well as a healthy passion for programming), <a href="mailto::zmckee@hawk.iit.edu">I'd love to hear from you.</a></p>
			<p>For my choice of programming languages, I am most experienced (and comfortable) with Python. I also have experience writing programs in Java and C, though I can quickly adapt to new imperative languages relatively quickly. I also have a small amount of experience with functional programming, though I have not been completely able to adjust to the functional paradigm yet.</p>
			<p>I also have classroom experience with SQL (Oracle SQL and PostgreSQL) -- so I'm able to do work with databases.</p>
			<p>I primarily use Windows as my operating system of choice. That being said, I also do a lot of my work in Linux -- I wrote up the HTML/CSS for this site in Vim, for example.</p>
