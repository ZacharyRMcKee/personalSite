			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>I am a second-year Computer Science student currently studying at the Illinois Institute of Technology. I am also a Teaching Assistant for CS 350 (Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming).</p>
			<p>In addition to pursuing my studies, I'm in the process of searching for a software development internship position for summer 2018. If you are looking for an intern with a solid foundation in computer science concepts (as well as a healthy passion for programming), <a href="mailto::zmckee@hawk.iit.edu">I'd love to hear from you.</a></p>
			<p>I have started attending my first hackathons in fall 2017 by attending <a href="https://mhacks.org/">MHacks X</a> and <a href="https://boilermake.org/home">Boilermake V</a> back-to-back. You can find specific details about the things I helped make at my <a href="https://devpost.com/ZacharyMcKee">Devpost profile.</a> I have thoroughly enjoyed my first experiences at both of these hackathons, and plan on attending MHacks 11 and Boilermake VI in the future.</p>
			<p>For my choice of programming languages, I am most experienced (and comfortable) with Python. I also have experience writing programs in Java and C, though I can adapt to new imperative languages relatively quickly. I also have a small amount of experience with functional programming, though I have not been completely able to adjust to the functional paradigm yet.</p>
			<p>I also have classroom experience with SQL (Oracle SQL and PostgreSQL) -- so I'm able to do work with databases.</p>
			<p>I use both Windows and Linux as operating systems of choice, depending on the task at hand -- if I'm doing a lot of programming work, I'll boot Ubuntu. If I want to take advantage of Microsoft's technologies (primarily for gaming), I'll switch to Windows.</p>
			<h2>Personal</h2>
			<p>I sometimes joke to myself that I was born with a keyboard in my hands. Since I was very little, computers have always fascinated me. The sheer complexity that goes into these machines is captivating -- if you have seen the schematics for any processor (such as the <a href=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Intel_8008_arch.svg/1280px-Intel_8008_arch.svg.png>Intel 8008</a>), you know what I mean.</p>
			<p>In my free time, I enjoy PC gaming. Some old favorite titles of mine include Team Fortress 2, the Mass Effect series, and Simcity 4. </p>
			<p>Recently, I've also started to enjoy cooking -- it's somewhat similar to programming in that when you do either of these things, you start with a simple collection of entities (ingredients in cooking, language syntax and keywords in programming) that you put together to form a complex, rich final product.</p>
